# Welcome to Day 5 {background-color="#40666e"}

## The Week's Journey

### What We've Built Together

**Day 1:** Experienced the challenges, discovered the Three Gulfs

**Day 2:** Learned systematic prompt engineering

**Day 3:** Mastered evaluation methodology

**Day 4:** Applied synthesis to real literature review

:::{.fragment}
**Today:** Bringing it all together and planning your next steps
:::

## Today's Objectives

### A Different Kind of Day

**This morning:**

- See real-world implementations
- Collaboratively synthesize what we've learned
- Document our collective insights

---

## Today's Objectives (cont.)

### A Different Kind of Day

**This afternoon:**

- Individual lab consultations (open office hours)
- Planning your AI-assisted research workflows
- Wrapping up loose ends

:::{.fragment}
[Today is about transition:]{.alert} From course to practice
:::

# Our Approach Today {background-color="#40666e"}

## Why Day 5 Is Different

### Flexible and Responsive

**We've intentionally kept today open because:**

- You might need more time on Day 4 topics
- Questions and discussions may have emerged
- Each lab has unique needs
- Real learning happens in application

:::{.fragment}
**Our philosophy:** Respond to where YOU are, not a rigid schedule
:::

## This Week Is Exploratory

### Shaping Something New Together

**Why this course is different:**

- AI for literature review is still emerging
- We're figuring out best practices together
- Your feedback shapes the approach
- No "right answers" yet - we're exploring

---

## Contributing Together

### What This Week Enables

**Through this course:**

- Share how AI tools work in your domains
- Contribute to IAEA/FAO lab guidelines
- Help document what works (and what doesn't)

:::{.fragment}
[We're all learning together]{.alert}
:::

# Morning Sessions {background-color="#40666e"}

## Real-World Case Studies

### What's Possible at Scale

**Two implementations I'll share:**

1. **MARIS RAG System (IAEA Monaco)**
   - IP-aware synthesis at scale
   - Synthetic question generation for evaluation

## Real-World Case Studies (cont.)

### What's Possible at Scale

**2. IOM Evidence Gap Mapping**

   - Multi-step LLM prompts
   - Evaluating reports against frameworks

:::{.fragment}
**Goal:** Show principles from this week applied in production
:::

## Why Show These?

### Learning from Real Implementations

**These examples demonstrate:**

- How evaluation scales in practice
- IP compliance in production systems
- Multi-step workflows
- Custom tooling when needed
- Lessons learned from deployment

## Collaborative Synthesis

### Capturing Our Collective Learning

**What I did last night:**

- Pulled all your Google doc contributions
- Used SolveIt to synthesize themes and patterns
- Drafted initial structure and sections

:::{.fragment}
**This morning:**

- I'll share what emerged
- We'll refine it together
- You'll see the synthesis workflow in action
:::

## Why This Matters

### You're Co-Authors of Knowledge

**This synthesis will:**

- Document your insights and challenges
- Capture methodology we developed together
- Create guidelines for IAEA/FAO labs
- Potentially become a publication??


# The Synthesis Process {background-color="#40666e"}

## What I Did Thursday Evening

### From Raw Notes to Structure

**The workflow:**

1. **Collected** all Google doc observations (Days 1-4)
2. **Loaded** into SolveIt as context
3. **Identified** themes and patterns
4. **Drafted** initial sections
5. **Prepared** for your feedback

:::{.fragment}
**This is exactly the process** we discussed in Day 4!
:::

## What We'll Do Together

### Collaborative Refinement

**This morning's session:**

1. **I'll present** the draft synthesis
2. **You'll react:** Does this capture your experience?
3. **We'll refine:** What's missing? What's wrong?
4. **We'll decide:** What should this become?

:::{.fragment}
**Improvised but intentional** - just like real research synthesis
:::

## Potential Outputs

### What This Could Become

**Possible formats:**

- **Internal guidelines:** AI-assisted literature review for IAEA/FAO
- **Methodology paper:** Novel approach to research synthesis
- **Training materials:** For other institutions
- **All/None of the above?**


# Afternoon: Individual Consultations {background-color="#40666e"}

## Open "Office Hours"

### Tailored Support per Lab

**How this works:**

- Contact me as you need help
- Discuss your specific use cases
- Plan AI workflows for your research
- Get guidance on next steps


## What We Can Discuss

### Possible Topics

- Specific prompts for your domain
- Tool selection for your constraints
- Evaluation strategies for your use cases
- Integration with current workflows

:::{.fragment}
**Or anything else** that would help you move forward
:::

## Why Keep It Open?

### Learning from Experience

**From past workshops:**

- Some labs come with clear questions
- Others need time to process
- Forcing structure doesn't help
- Best support is responsive


# What Happens After Today? {background-color="#40666e"}

## The Support Plan

### Continuing the Journey

**After this week:**

- Individual lab support (6 days total, shared across all labs)
- Help implementing what you learned
- Troubleshooting real applications
- Ongoing refinement


## The Synthesis Document

### Ongoing Collaboration

**After today:**

- I'll share the refined draft
- You can contribute asynchronously
- We'll iterate based on feedback
- Decide final format together

# Today's Schedule {background-color="#40666e"}

## Morning Timeline

### Real-World + Synthesis

**Sequence:**

1. Real-world case studies (MARIS, IOM)
2. Break
3. Collaborative synthesis session

:::{.fragment}
**Timing flexible** - we'll adjust based on discussion and questions
:::

# Questions Before We Start? {background-color="#40666e"}

## Setting Expectations

### What to Know

- Today is less structured by design
- Your participation shapes the day
- Focus on practical application
- Think about your next steps

:::{.fragment}
**Any questions about:**

- Today's agenda?
- The synthesis session?
- Individual consultations?
- What happens after?
:::

## Let's Begin

### First: Real-World Case Studies

**Coming up:**

- MARIS RAG (Monaco)
- IOM Evidence Gap Mapping
