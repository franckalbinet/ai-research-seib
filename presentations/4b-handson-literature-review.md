# Session 4B: Hands-On Guide - Multi-Paper Synthesis

## Overview
This hands-on session lets you practice the intentional synthesis approach with your own papers and tools. You'll apply the principles from Session 4A to create a small literature synthesis.

**What you need:**
- 3-5 papers from your research area (ideally already extracted from Day 2)
- Access to your preferred AI tool (Copilot Pro, ChatGPT, Claude, NotebookLM, etc.)
- Clear synthesis goal
- The shared Google doc for notes

**Time:** ~90 minutes

---

## Step 1: Define Your Synthesis Task (15 minutes)

### Clarify What You're Synthesizing

**Answer these questions:**

1. **Topic/Question:** What specific aspect are you synthesizing?
   - Example: "Drought tolerance mechanisms in tropical crops"
   - Example: "Isotope techniques for nutrient uptake studies"

2. **Audience:** Who will read this?
   - Researchers in your field?
   - Policy makers?
   - Students?

3. **Purpose:** Why does this synthesis matter?
   - Identify research gaps?
   - Compare methodologies?
   - Summarize current state of knowledge?

4. **Scope:** What will you cover?
   - Time period?
   - Geographic focus?
   - Specific methods or approaches?

**Write these down** - they become part of your context.

---

## Step 2: Prepare Your Context (20 minutes)

### Gather and Organize

**What you need to prepare:**

1. **Your papers:**
   - Use your Day 2 extractions if available
   - If not, create brief summaries (key findings, methods, results)

2. **Structure outline:**
   - What sections will your synthesis have?
   - Example: Introduction → Methods comparison → Key findings → Gaps → Conclusions

3. **Style and tone:**
   - Formal or accessible?
   - Technical detail level?
   - Any example text to match?

4. **IP requirements:**
   - Include the IP constraints from Session 4A
   - Paraphrase, don't copy
   - Limit quotations
   - Always cite

**Template to fill:**
```
SYNTHESIS TASK:
Topic: [your topic]
Audience: [your audience]
Purpose: [your purpose]
Scope: [your scope]

STRUCTURE:
1. [Section 1]
2. [Section 2]
3. [Section 3]
...

IP REQUIREMENTS:
- Paraphrase all content
- Maximum one short quote per source (<20 words)
- Always cite (Author, Year)
- Transform through synthesis

PAPERS:
[List your 3-5 papers with brief summaries]
```

---

## Step 3: Choose Your Tool & Approach (10 minutes)

### Match Tool to Task

**Consider your options:**

**Microsoft Copilot Pro** (you all have this):
- Integrated in Word/Office
- Good for iterative writing
- Can reference documents
- Approach: Work section by section in Word

**NotebookLM:**
- Upload your paper PDFs
- Good cross-source synthesis
- Citation tracking
- Approach: Upload all papers, ask synthesis questions

**ChatGPT/Claude:**
- Powerful conversation
- Limited context window
- Approach: Paste context, work iteratively

**Other tools:**
- Elicit, SciSpace, etc.
- Explore their synthesis features

**Choose based on:**
- What you have access to
- Context window needs
- Your comfort level

---

## Step 4: Start with Outline (15 minutes)

### Refine Your Structure

**Your first prompt might be:**

```
I'm writing a literature synthesis on [topic] for [audience].

Purpose: [your purpose]

I have 3-5 papers covering:
- [Paper 1 brief description]
- [Paper 2 brief description]
- [Paper 3 brief description]

My initial outline is:
[Your structure from Step 2]

Please suggest improvements to this outline:
- What sections might be missing?
- What order makes most sense?
- How can I best highlight connections between studies?
```

**Iterate on the outline** until you're satisfied with the structure.

---

## Step 5: Work Section by Section (30 minutes)

### Intentional, Iterative Synthesis

**For each section:**

1. **Provide context for this section:**
   ```
   For the [section name] section:
   
   Relevant papers:
   [Paste relevant extracts]
   
   What this section should cover:
   [Your goals for this section]
   
   IP requirements:
   - Paraphrase, don't copy
   - Cite all sources
   - Synthesize, don't just summarize
   
   Please draft this section.
   ```

2. **Review the output:**
   - Does it synthesize or just summarize?
   - Are connections between studies clear?
   - Is it properly cited?
   - Does it meet IP requirements?

3. **Refine:**
   - Edit the AI's output
   - Ask for revisions on specific parts
   - Guide the direction

**Remember:** You're driving, AI is assisting.

## Step 6: Evaluate Your Synthesis (10 minutes)

### Quality Check

**Use Day 3 evaluation mindset:**

**Check for:**
- ✅ Proper citations throughout
- ✅ Paraphrasing, not copying
- ✅ Synthesis (connections) not just summary
- ✅ Consistent tone and style
- ✅ Addresses your stated purpose
- ✅ Appropriate for your audience

**Failure modes to watch for:**
- Verbatim copying (IP violation)
- Missing citations
- List of summaries instead of synthesis
- Missing connections between studies
- Inconsistent level of detail

## Reflection & Documentation

### Capture Your Experience

**In the shared Google doc, note:**

1. **What worked well:**
   - Which tool did you use?
   - What aspects of the workflow were effective?
   - Any pleasant surprises?

2. **What was challenging:**
   - Where did you get stuck?
   - What did your tool struggle with?
   - What required most iteration?

3. **Comparison to your usual process:**
   - Faster? Slower?
   - Better quality?
   - More or less effort?

4. **What you'd do differently:**
   - How would you adapt this for real work?
   - What preparation would help?
   - What tool features would you need?

## Tips & Troubleshooting

### Common Challenges

**"The AI just summarizes each paper separately"**
- Be explicit: "Synthesize by comparing and connecting findings"
- Ask: "What patterns emerge across these studies?"
- Guide: "How do these results complement or contradict each other?"

**"Context window too small"**
- Work with fewer papers at once
- Use shorter extracts focusing on key findings
- Work section by section

**"Output doesn't match my style"**
- Provide example text to match
- Be specific about tone (formal, accessible, technical)
- Edit and show the AI your preferred style

**"Citations are inconsistent"**
- Specify format clearly: "(Author, Year)" or "[1]"
- Check and correct manually
- Include citation format in every prompt

**"It's copying text verbatim"**
- Emphasize paraphrasing in prompt
- Check output carefully
- Revise sections that are too close to source

---

## Optional: Advanced Techniques

### If You Have Time

**Try these approaches:**

1. **Comparative tables:**
   - Ask AI to create comparison tables of methods, results
   - Very useful for synthesis

2. **Gap analysis:**
   - "Based on these papers, what research gaps exist?"
   - "What questions remain unanswered?"

3. **Figure suggestions:**
   - "Where would figures or diagrams help?"
   - "What could be visualized?"

4. **Multiple passes:**
   - First pass: content and connections
   - Second pass: flow and transitions
   - Third pass: style and polish

---

## Time Check

**If you're running short on time:**

- Focus on 1-2 sections well rather than rushing through all
- The process matters more than completion
- Document what you learned

**If you finish early:**

- Try a different tool and compare
- Help a colleague
- Add detailed reflections to shared doc
