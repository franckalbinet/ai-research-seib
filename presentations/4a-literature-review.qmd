# Welcome to Day 4 {background-color="#40666e"}

## Where We've Been

### Your Journey So Far

**Day 1:** Experienced the challenges, learned the Three Gulfs

**Day 2:** Built extraction prompts systematically

**Day 3:** Learned to evaluate rigorously

:::{.fragment}
**Today:** Putting it all together for real literature review work
:::

## Today's Focus

### From Single Papers to Synthesis

**The central challenge:**

- You've extracted information from individual papers
- But literature review requires **synthesis** across papers
- Finding connections, patterns, gaps
- Creating coherent narrative

:::{.fragment}
[This is what you actually need for your work!]{.alert}
:::

## Before We Start

### Opening Discussion + Shared Doc

**First, we want to hear from YOU:**

- Your current literature review practices
- What's challenging about synthesis
- What tools you use

:::{.fragment}
**Please contribute to our [shared doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ub6KZBYAOBVYRXI5P3UX7xjSgwChOxwonWWgbidUOr0/edit?tab=t.0)**
:::

:::{.fragment}
**Then:** We'll show you one approach and extract principles together
:::

# Your Current Practice {background-color="#40666e"}

:::{.fragment}
**Let's see one approach to addressing these challenges**
:::

# A Real-World Example {background-color="#40666e"}

## The Project

### Writing a Book Chapter with IAEA Colleague

**The task:**

- Chapter on banana, cassava, and coffee isotope research
- 20+ reference papers to synthesize
- Specific audience and style requirements
- Must respect IP/copyright constraints

:::{.fragment}
**The approach:** Intentional, iterative, AI-assisted synthesis
:::

## What "Intentional" Means

### Not Just Throwing Papers at AI

**Intentional synthesis requires:**

- Carefully crafted context
- Clear specifications
- Iterative refinement
- Human guidance and control

:::{.fragment}
[Key insight:]{.alert} You can't just prompt "write my literature review" and expect quality
:::

# Live Demo: The Workflow {background-color="#40666e"}

## What We'll Show

### Four Key Aspects

1. **Crafted context** - The preparation work
2. **Pooling context** - Dynamic information retrieval
3. **Steering through editing** - Driving the AI
4. **Iteration** - The reality of the process

:::{.fragment}
**Tool:** SolveIt (advanced features, but principles transfer)
:::

## [Live Demo Part 1]

### The Preparation: Crafted Context

**Before starting synthesis:**

- Book/chapter TOC and outline
- 20+ papers pre-extracted (Day 2 methods)
- Style calibration document
- IP requirements specified

:::{.fragment}
**This preparation enables quality synthesis**
:::

## Why This Preparation Matters
### Precision and Recall for Synthesis

**Information retrieval concepts apply here:**

- **Recall:** Did we capture all relevant information from papers?
- **Precision:** Is the information we provide actually useful?

:::{.fragment}
**Good context = High recall + High precision**

- Extract comprehensively (Day 2 methods)
- Filter to what's relevant for this synthesis
:::

:::{.fragment}
[Poor context → Poor synthesis]{.alert}
:::


## [Live Demo Part 2]

### The Process: Iteration and Control

**Working through synthesis:**

- Dynamic context pooling (tool calls)
- Editing AI outputs to steer direction
- Outline → sections → transitions → intro
- Multiple refinement passes

:::{.fragment}
**Human guidance at every step**
:::


# Key Principles {background-color="#40666e"}

## What Made This Work

### Transferable Lessons

**1. Context is everything**

- Pre-process papers systematically (Day 2 extraction!)
- Define audience, purpose, structure upfront
- Provide style examples
- Specify constraints (IP, length, tone)

:::{.fragment}
**This preparation is 50% of the work** - but it's what makes synthesis possible
:::

## What Made This Work (cont.)

### Transferable Lessons

**2. Work iteratively, not linearly**

- Start with outline refinement
- Work section by section
- Refine transitions and flow
- Write introduction last

---

## What Made This Work (cont.)

### Transferable Lessons

**3. Maintain control**

- Edit AI outputs to guide direction
- Don't accept everything as-is
- You're the expert, AI is the assistant

:::{.fragment}
[Remember:]{.alert} AI scales your effort, doesn't replace your judgment
:::

## The Role of Evaluation

### Connecting to Day 3

**Throughout the process:**

- Check for failure modes identified in evaluation
- Ensure consistency across sections
- Verify IP compliance
- Maintain quality standards

:::{.fragment}
[This is why Day 3 matters!]{.alert} Evaluation guides refinement
:::

# IP Constraints {background-color="#40666e"}

## Why This Matters

### Legal and Ethical Requirements

**When synthesizing from papers:**

- Cannot reproduce copyrighted text verbatim
- Must paraphrase and transform
- Proper attribution essential
- Fair use principles apply

:::{.fragment}
**For IAEA/FAO work:** Particularly critical for public-facing documents
:::

## IP-Aware Synthesis

### Key Requirements

From the MARIS system approach:

- **Paraphrase and synthesize** - don't copy
- **Limit quotations** - max 2-3 sentences, always cited
- **Transform, don't reproduce** - add analytical value
- **Always attribute** - cite sources properly

:::{.fragment}
**These constraints must be in your synthesis prompt**
:::

## Example IP Specifications

### From Our Workflow

```
**IP Requirements:**
- Paraphrase all content, do not reproduce verbatim
- Maximum one short quote per source (under 20 words)
- Always provide citations in (Author, Year) format
- Transform information through synthesis and analysis
- Respect copyright while providing educational value
```

:::{.fragment}
**This becomes part of your context** - guides the AI throughout
:::

# Tool Considerations {background-color="#40666e"}

## What About Your Tools?
### Exploring Different Approaches

**SolveIt features shown:**

- Advanced context pooling (tool calls)
- Granular editing control
- Persistent conversation with full context

:::{.fragment}
**But many tools can support this workflow** - each with different strengths
:::

## Your Available Tools

### Different Strengths for Synthesis

**You all have access to:**
- **Microsoft Copilot Pro** (integrated in Office)

**Other options you might use:**

- ChatGPT/Claude - Powerful models, iterative work
- NotebookLM - Synthesis across sources, citations
- Elicit/SciSpace - Research-specific workflows
- ... and many more

:::{.fragment}
**In Session 4B:** Explore what's possible with your preferred tool
:::

## Adapting the Approach

### What's Possible Without SolveIt?

**Core principles still work:**

- Pre-extract papers (you learned this Day 2!)
- Prepare context documents
- Work section by section
- Iterate and refine

:::{.fragment}
**Limitations to work around:**
- Smaller context windows → work in smaller chunks
- Less control → more careful prompt engineering
- No tool calls → manually manage context
:::

## NotebookLM Example

### A Good Alternative

**NotebookLM strengths for this:**

- Upload multiple source documents
- Good at synthesis across sources
- Citation tracking
- Conversational interface

:::{.fragment}
**Try it in Session 4B** - see what's possible with your tools
:::

# The Intentional Approach {background-color="#40666e"}

## What We Mean by "Intentional"

### Deliberate, Not Delegated

**Intentional synthesis means:**

1. **You define** the structure and narrative
2. **You prepare** the context carefully
3. **You guide** the iteration process
4. **You evaluate** the outputs critically
5. **You refine** based on your expertise

:::{.fragment}
[AI assists, but you drive]{.alert}
:::

## Why This Matters

### Avoiding the "Magic Button" Trap

**The temptation:**

> "Just give AI all my papers and let it write the review"

:::{.fragment}
**Why this doesn't work:**

- Quality requires your domain expertise
- Structure needs your strategic thinking
:::


## Why This Matters (cont.)

### Your Expertise Is Essential

**AI cannot replace:**

- Your analytical judgment for synthesis
- Your critical eye for evaluation
- Your understanding of what matters in your field

:::{.fragment}
[Key principle:]{.alert} AI scales your effort, doesn't replace it
:::

## The Effort Distribution

### A Hypothesis to Discuss

**Traditional approach:** Heavy on reading/extraction

**AI-assisted approach:** Shifts toward preparation, guidance, and critical evaluation

:::{.fragment}
**Key questions:**

- Does this actually save time overall?
- Or does it produce better quality for similar effort?
- What's the learning curve cost?
:::

:::{.fragment}
**Your experience:** What would your distribution look like?
:::
