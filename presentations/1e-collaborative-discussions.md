## Purpose
This is an open, collaborative session to:
- Understand your current practices and pain points
- Surface expectations and concerns about using AI
- Discuss ethical considerations together
- Build shared understanding as a group

**Format:** Facilitated discussion with note-taking (no formal presentation)

## Part 1: Current Practices & Pain Points

### Your Literature Review Workflow

**Understanding the landscape:**
- "How many papers do you typically review for a project?"
- "Where do you store your notes - Word docs? Spreadsheets? Reference managers? Something else?"
- "Do you read papers sequentially or jump around sections?"

**Pain points:**
- "What takes the longest - finding papers or extracting information?"
- "Ever lost important details because your notes were unclear?"
- "What's the most frustrating part of literature review for you?"

### What You Extract from Papers

**Must-have information:**
- "What's the first thing you look for in a paper's results section?"
- "Do you extract methodology details? Which ones matter most?"
- "How do you capture statistical findings - copy exact numbers or summarize?"
- "Do you describe figures and tables? How?"

**Quality control:**
- "How do you make sure you didn't miss anything important?"
- "Ever go back to re-read because your notes weren't clear enough?"
- "Do you use any templates or checklists?"

### Current Tools

**Quick inventory:**
- "Who's using Mendeley, Zotero, EndNote, or something else?"
- "Do you annotate PDFs directly or take separate notes?"
- "Any other tools in your workflow?"

## Part 2: Expectations & Dream Scenarios

### If AI Could Help...

**Automation wishes:**
- "If you could automate one part of literature review, what would it be?"
- "What would your perfect paper summary look like?"
- "How would you want to compare findings across 20 papers?"
- "If you had unlimited time, what would you extract that you currently skip?"

**Realistic expectations:**
- "What do you hope to get out of this course?"
- "What would make AI 'good enough' for your work?"

## Part 3: Concerns & Ethical Considerations

### Your Concerns About Using AI

**Open discussion:**
- "What worries you most about using AI in your research?"
- "Have you had bad experiences with AI tools? What happened?"
- "What would make you NOT trust an AI-generated summary?"

**Common concerns to discuss:**
- Accuracy and hallucinations
- Losing deep understanding of the literature
- Dependency on AI
- What if AI misses something critical?
- Reproducibility of AI-assisted work

### Ethical & IP Questions

**Attribution and authorship:**
- "If AI helps write your literature review, how do you attribute it?"
- "What does your institution/journal say about AI use?"
- "Where's the line between 'AI-assisted' and 'AI-generated'?"

**Intellectual property:**
- "Are you concerned about feeding papers into commercial AI tools?"
- "What about copyright when AI reads and summarizes papers?"
- "Who owns the AI-generated summaries?"

**Research integrity:**
- "Will AI help us do BETTER research or just FASTER research?"
- "What should we delegate to AI vs. keep under human control?"
- "How do we maintain critical thinking while using AI?"

### Institutional Policies

**Understanding constraints:**
- "Does your lab/institution have AI use policies?"
- "Are there restrictions on what data you can share with AI tools?"
- "What about data privacy and confidentiality?"

## Part 4: Building Our Framework Together

### Collective Principles

Based on our discussion, let's start identifying:
- **Red lines:** What should we NOT do with AI?
- **Green lights:** What seems safe and beneficial?
- **Yellow zones:** What needs more discussion/guidelines?

**Note:** We'll return to this throughout the week and formalize it on Day 5.
