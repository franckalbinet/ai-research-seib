# What Did You Just Experience? {background-color="#40666e"}

## Debrief: Your First Encounter

### Let's Hear From You

**Quick round of sharing:**

- What worked well in your paper extraction attempt?
- What was frustrating or confusing?
- Did the AI give you what you expected?

## Common Patterns

### A Recurring Theme Across Users

When working with AI, a recurring theme emerges:

- **"It gave me something, but not quite what I wanted"**
- **"The output format kept changing"**
- **"I wasn't sure how to describe what I needed"**
- **"It worked for one input but not another"**

[Sound familiar?]{.alert} There's a reason for this...

# The Three Gulfs Framework {background-color="#40666e"}

## Understanding AI Pipeline Challenges

### A Framework to Make Sense of It All

:::{.fragment}
**This framework helps explain** what you just experienced and guides our journey through this course
:::

## Gulf 1: Comprehension

### You ↔ Your Data

**The challenge:** Understanding your input data (scientific papers) and how your AI pipeline behaves on that data at scale.

:::{.fragment}
**What you just experienced:**

- You couldn't easily check if the AI extracted everything important
- Hard to know if it would work the same way on your next 50 papers
- Difficult to spot patterns in what it missed or got wrong
:::

:::{.fragment}
[Critical insight:]{.alert} We need systematic ways to understand our data and AI performance at scale
:::

## Gulf 2: Specification

### You ↔ AI Pipeline

**The challenge:** The gap between what you want the AI to do and what you actually communicate in your prompts.

:::{.fragment}
**What you just experienced:**

- "Extract key information" - but what exactly is "key"?
- Should it be bullets or paragraphs?
- How detailed should methodology be?
- What format do you actually want?
:::

:::{.fragment}
[Key point:]{.alert} Seemingly clear instructions often contain hidden ambiguities
:::

## Gulf 3: Generalization

### Your Data ↔ AI Pipeline

**The challenge:** Even with perfect prompts, AI may behave inconsistently across different inputs.

:::{.fragment}
**What you might experience next:**

- Your prompt works great for experimental papers, fails on theoretical ones
- Different paper structures confuse the AI
- Older vs. newer publications get different treatment
:::

:::{.fragment}
[Important:]{.alert} Each application requires bridging the Three Gulfs anew - there are no universal solutions
:::

## Why This Framework Matters

### Guiding Our Course Journey

Understanding the Three Gulfs helps us:

1. **Expect iteration** - Perfect prompts don't exist from the start
2. **Plan for evaluation** - We need systematic ways to assess performance
3. **Design for diversity** - Our approach must work across different paper types
4. **Stay methodical** - Each gulf requires specific strategies to bridge

:::{.fragment}
**This week's structure:** We'll address each gulf systematically through hands-on practice
:::

## Connecting to Your Experience

### Which Gulf Did You Feel Most?

Think about your hands-on session:

- **Gulf of Comprehension:** Couldn't easily verify the output?
- **Gulf of Specification:** Struggled to describe what you wanted?
- **Gulf of Generalization:** Worried it won't work on other papers?

:::{.fragment}
[Most likely:]{.alert} You experienced all three! That's completely normal.

## The Week Ahead

### How We'll Bridge Each Gulf

**Days 2-3:** Addressing the Gulf of Specification
- Systematic prompt engineering
- Iterative refinement techniques

**Day 3:** Addressing the Gulf of Comprehension
- Evaluation methodology
- Understanding performance at scale

**Days 4-5:** Addressing the Gulf of Generalization
- Real-world applications
- Handling diverse paper types and use cases

## Before We Move On

### Final Thoughts

- Does this framework help make sense of your experience?
- Which gulf feels most challenging for your work?
- What questions do you have?
