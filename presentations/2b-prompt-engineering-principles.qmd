# The Seven Building Blocks {background-color="#40666e"}

## Prompting Fundamentals

### The Components of Effective Prompts

A well-structured prompt typically includes:

1. **Role and Objective** - Define the AI's persona and goal
2. **Instructions / Response Rules** - Clear, specific directives
3. **Context** - The relevant background information
4. **Examples** - Few-shot prompting for guidance
5. **Reasoning Steps** - Chain-of-thought prompting
6. **Output Formatting** - Structure and constraints
7. **Delimiters** - Clear organization of prompt sections

:::{.fragment}
**Reference:** See the full guidelines in `resources/prompt_fundamentals.md`
:::

## Why These Building Blocks?

### Addressing the Gulf of Specification

Remember the Three Gulfs from Day 1?

:::{.fragment}
**Gulf of Specification:** The gap between what you want and what you communicate

These building blocks help you:

- Make your intent explicit
- Reduce ambiguity
- Get consistent outputs
- Bridge that gulf systematically
:::

## Our Iterative Approach

### How We'll Work Today

We'll build a paper extraction prompt in cycles:

1. **Start simple** - Basic instruction only
2. **Add complexity** - One building block at a time
3. **Test and observe** - What changed?
4. **Refine** - Based on what we learned

:::{.fragment}
[Important:]{.alert} This is how real prompt engineering works - iteration, not perfection on the first try
:::

# Cycle 1: Basic Instruction {background-color="#40666e"}

## Building Block: Instructions

### Starting at the Simplest Level

**The core component:** Clear, specific directives for the task

:::{.fragment}
**For paper extraction, a basic instruction might be:**

> "Summarize this scientific paper."

or

> "Extract key information from this paper."
:::

:::{.fragment}
**Question:** What's missing from these instructions?
:::

## What Makes Good Instructions?

### Key Characteristics

- **Specific:** Define exactly what to do
- **Unambiguous:** One clear interpretation
- **Actionable:** The AI knows what action to take
- **Complete:** Covers the full scope of the task

:::{.fragment}
**But even good instructions alone aren't enough...**
:::

## Hands-On: Cycle 1

### Your Turn - Basic Instruction

**Task:** Create a basic instruction-only prompt for paper extraction

**See:** `session-2c-hands-on.md` for detailed guidance

**Time:** 15 minutes

:::{.fragment}
**Remember to note:**

- What output did you get?
- What was good?
- What was missing or inconsistent?
:::

---

## Debrief: Cycle 1

### What Did We Learn?

**Group discussion:**

- What worked with basic instructions?
- What problems did you encounter?
- What would you want to improve?

:::{.fragment}
[Common pattern:]{.alert} The AI gives you *something*, but probably not quite what you wanted
:::

# Cycle 2: Adding Role & Objective {background-color="#40666e"}

## Building Blocks: Role and Objective

### Setting the Context

**Role:** Define the AI's persona

- Helps the AI "understand" its perspective
- Influences tone and approach

**Objective:** State the overall goal

- Provides purpose beyond the immediate instruction
- Helps prioritize what matters

## Example: Role & Objective

### For Paper Extraction

**Role:**

> "You are a scientific literature extraction specialist with expertise in [domain] research."

**Objective:**

> "Generate a comprehensive, structured summary of the provided scientific paper optimized for literature review preparation."

:::{.fragment}
**Notice:** This adds context *around* your instructions
:::

## Why This Matters

### Influencing AI Behavior

Adding role and objective:

- Activates relevant "knowledge" in the model
- Sets appropriate tone and detail level
- Provides decision-making criteria
- Makes the task feel more bounded

:::{.fragment}
[Key point:]{.alert} You're not just saying WHAT to do, but WHO is doing it and WHY
:::

## Hands-On: Cycle 2

### Your Turn - Add Role & Objective

**Task:** Enhance your Cycle 1 prompt by adding:
- An appropriate role
- A clear objective

**See:** `session-2c-hands-on.md` for guidance

**Time:** 15 minutes

:::{.fragment}
**Compare:** How does the output differ from Cycle 1?
:::

---

## Debrief: Cycle 2

### What Changed?

**Group discussion:**

- How did adding role/objective affect the output?
- Was it more aligned with what you wanted?
- What issues persist?

:::{.fragment}
**Next challenge:** The output might be better, but is it *structured* the way you need?
:::

# Cycle 3: Output Formatting {background-color="#40666e"}

## Building Block: Output Formatting

### Defining Structure and Constraints

**The challenge:** Even good content isn't useful if it's not structured properly

:::{.fragment}
**Output formatting specifies:**

- Structure (sections, lists, tables)
- Format (JSON, Markdown, plain text)
- Constraints (length, level of detail)
- Required elements
:::

## Example: Output Formatting

### For Paper Extraction

```
**Format required:**
- Title and citation information
- Abstract (original, verbatim)
- Key takeaways by section (bullet points)
- Methodology summary
- Main results with statistics
- Figures and tables described
- Maximum 2000 tokens
```

:::{.fragment}
[Critical:]{.alert} Be explicit about structure - don't assume the AI will guess correctly
:::

## Why Formatting Matters

### Consistency and Usability

Explicit formatting requirements:

- Ensure consistency across multiple papers
- Make outputs machine-readable (if needed)
- Enable comparison and synthesis later
- Reduce variability in results

:::{.fragment}
**This directly addresses:** Gulf of Specification AND Gulf of Generalization
:::

## Hands-On: Cycle 3

### Your Turn - Add Output Formatting

**Task:** Add detailed formatting requirements to your prompt

**See:** `session-2c-hands-on.md` for guidance

**Time:** 20 minutes

:::{.fragment}
**Pay attention to:** How much more consistent is the output now?
:::

---

## Debrief: Cycle 3

### Progress Check

**Group discussion:**

- Is the structure now what you need?
- Are outputs more consistent?
- What would still improve it?

:::{.fragment}
**Pattern emerging:** More specific prompts → more consistent outputs
:::

# Cycle 4: Context & Examples {background-color="#40666e"}

## Building Blocks: Context and Examples

### Providing Background and Guidance

**Context:** Relevant background information

- Domain-specific knowledge
- Constraints or requirements
- What the output will be used for

**Examples (Few-shot):** Sample input-output pairs

- Shows exactly what you want
- Clarifies ambiguous instructions
- Demonstrates edge cases

## When to Use Examples

### The Power of Few-Shot Prompting

Examples are especially valuable when:

- Instructions are complex or nuanced
- You want a specific style or format
- Edge cases need to be handled
- The task has implicit requirements

:::{.fragment}
**Trade-off:** Examples take up token space but can dramatically improve results
:::

## Example: Adding Context

### For Paper Extraction

**Context example:**
```
**Context:** These summaries will be used as input for 
literature review synthesis. Focus on:
- Quantitative results with statistical measures
- Methodological approaches that could be compared
- Key findings relevant to [specific research question]

**Exclude:** Author affiliations, acknowledgments, 
funding information
```

## Hands-On: Cycle 4

### Your Turn - Add Context

**Task:** Add relevant context to your prompt

- What will the summary be used for?
- What should be prioritized?
- What should be excluded?

**Optional:** Add an example if helpful

**See:** `session-2c-hands-on.md` for guidance

**Time:** 20 minutes

---

## Debrief: Cycle 4

### Refinement Continues

**Group discussion:**

- Did context help focus the output?
- If you used examples, how did they help?
- Is the output now "good enough" for your needs?

:::{.fragment}
[Key question:]{.alert} When is a prompt "good enough"? (It depends on your use case!)
:::

# Advanced Building Blocks {background-color="#40666e"}

## Reasoning Steps

### Chain-of-Thought Prompting

**When to use:**
- Complex analysis tasks
- Multi-step reasoning needed
- Want to see the AI's thinking process

**Example:** "Think step by step before answering"

:::{.fragment}
**For paper extraction:** Less critical, but useful for evaluation tasks
:::

## Delimiters

### Organizing Complex Prompts

**Purpose:** Clear separation of prompt sections

**Common markers:** `###`, `---`, XML tags

:::{.fragment}
**For paper extraction:** Helpful as prompts grow more complex
:::

## When to Use Reasoning Steps

### Chain-of-Thought Prompting

Best for tasks requiring:

- Multi-step analysis
- Comparison or evaluation, complex decision-making, verification of results

:::{.fragment}
**Example for evaluation task:**

> "Before rating this paper's methodology, first identify the study design, then assess each component (sampling, measurement, analysis), and finally provide an overall rating with justification."
:::

## Cycle 5 (Optional): Advanced Features

### Your Choice

**If time allows and interest exists:**

Add reasoning steps or better organization with delimiters

**See:** `session-2c-hands-on.md` for guidance

**Time:** 15-20 minutes

# The Complete Picture {background-color="#40666e"}

## From Simple to Sophisticated

### Your Prompt Evolution

You've built a prompt from:

1. ✅ Basic instruction
2. ✅ + Role & Objective
3. ✅ + Output Formatting
4. ✅ + Context (& Examples)
5. ✅ (Optional) Reasoning Steps & Delimiters

:::{.fragment}
**This is the iterative process** of real prompt engineering
:::

## The Professional Version

### Where This Can Lead

**Example:** The `prompt_paper_representation.md` shows a fully developed version

- All building blocks integrated
- Comprehensive specifications
- Error handling
- Quality standards

:::{.fragment}
[Important truth:]{.alert} This wasn't written perfectly from the start - it evolved through iteration
:::

## Honesty Moment

### How the Example Prompt Was Created

**The truth about `prompt_paper_representation.md`:**

1. I built an initial version using these principles
2. I tested it on several papers
3. I identified failure modes
4. **I asked Claude AI to refine it** based on my observations
5. I tested again and refined further

:::{.fragment}
**Lesson:** Use AI to help refine prompts, but start with human-led iteration first
:::

## Why Start Manual?

### The Value of Doing It Yourself First

**Manual iteration first teaches you:**

- What you actually want to achieve
- Hidden requirements and edge cases
- How to recognize failure modes
- How to evaluate quality

:::{.fragment}
**Then AI refinement helps with:**

- Phrasing and clarity
- Comprehensive coverage
- Formatting and organization
:::

:::{.fragment}

## Sharing Our Work

### What Did We Build?

**Activity:** Let's see a few examples

- Volunteers share their final prompts
- What building blocks did you emphasize?
- What worked well for your domain?
- What challenges remain?

:::{.fragment}
**Time:** 15-20 minutes
:::

## Common Patterns

### What We Typically See

Across different domains and approaches:

- **Variation in detail level** - Some want more, some less
- **Domain-specific requirements** - Different fields need different information
- **Trade-offs** - Comprehensiveness vs. token limits
- **Personal style** - There's no single "right" prompt

:::{.fragment}
[Important insight:]{.alert} Good prompts are tailored to YOUR specific needs
:::

# Tomorrow: Evaluation {background-color="#40666e"}

## The Next Challenge

### How Do We Know It's Working?

Today you built prompts and observed outputs.

**But:**

- How do you evaluate systematically?
- What if you process 50 papers?
- How do you identify failure patterns?
- When is it "good enough"?

:::{.fragment}
**Tomorrow (Day 3):** We'll tackle systematic evaluation
:::

## Homework (Optional)

### Continue Experimenting

**If you'd like:**

- Test your prompt on 2-3 different papers (or other use cases)
- Note what works and what doesn't
- Add observations to the shared doc
- Try refining your prompt further

:::{.fragment}
**Question to ponder:** What would "good enough" look like for your actual research needs?
