## About This Course

### A 5-Day Intensive on AI-Assisted Research

**Who this is for:**

- IAEA/FAO laboratory researchers
- Anyone conducting literature reviews
- Those exploring AI tools for research
- People wanting systematic, rigorous approaches

:::{.fragment}
**What this is NOT:** A quick fix or "magic button" solution
:::

## What We'll Build Together

### An Intentional Approach

This week, we'll develop:

- Systematic paper extraction methods
- Rigorous evaluation practices
- Multi-paper synthesis workflows
- IP-aware research practices

:::{.fragment}
[Key principle:]{.alert} AI assists, but you drive the research process
:::

# Why This Course Exists {background-color="#40666e"}

## The Literature Review Challenge

### What You Face Daily

**Common pain points:**

- Reading and extracting from dozens of papers
- Maintaining consistency across studies
- Synthesizing findings into coherent narratives
- Keeping up with growing literature

:::{.fragment}
**Question:** Does this resonate with your experience?
:::

## The AI Promise

### What AI Can Do

**AI tools can:**

- Process large volumes quickly
- Extract structured information
- Identify patterns across papers
- Draft synthesis text

:::{.fragment}
**These are powerful capabilities** - but they're not the whole picture
:::


## The AI Reality

### What AI Cannot Do

**AI cannot:**

- Replace your domain expertise
- Understand what matters in your field
- Ensure quality without evaluation
- Work well without careful guidance

:::{.fragment}
[You remain essential]{.alert} - AI is a tool, not a replacement
:::


## Our Philosophy

### Intentional, Not Automated

**This course teaches:**

- How to guide AI effectively (not just use it)
- How to evaluate outputs rigorously (not trust blindly)
- How to maintain control (not delegate thinking)
- How to respect IP (not copy carelessly)

:::{.fragment}
[We're exploring together]{.alert} - AI for research is still emerging
:::

:::

# What Makes This Different {background-color="#40666e"}

## Not Just Tool Training

### A Methodological Approach

**Other courses might focus on:**

- How to use ChatGPT
- Prompt templates to copy
- "Best practices" to follow

## Our Approach

### What We Aim to Teach

**This course aims at teaching:**

- How to think about AI-assisted research
- How to develop your own approaches
- How to evaluate and improve systematically
- How to adapt to your specific needs

:::{.fragment}
[Methodology over templates]{.alert}
:::

## Collaborative and Exploratory

### We're Learning Together

**This course is:**

- First of its kind for IAEA/FAO labs (to my knowledge)
- Exploratory and adaptive
- Shaped by your feedback
- Contributing to new guidelines

:::{.fragment}
**Your input matters** - you're helping define best practices
:::

## Evidence-Based Methodology

### Built on Research

**Our approach draws from:**

- The Three Gulfs Model (Shankar & Husain)
- Qualitative research methods (open/axial coding)
- LLM evaluation research
- Real-world production systems

:::{.fragment}
**Not just opinions** - grounded in methodology
:::

# What You'll Leave With {background-color="#40666e"}

## Practical Outcomes

### Tangible Skills and Artifacts

**By Friday, you'll have:**

- Paper extraction prompts for your domain
- Evaluation methodologies you can apply
- Synthesis workflows you can use
- A collaborative report documenting our approach

:::{.fragment}
**Plus:** Follow-up support for your lab
:::

## Mindset Shifts

### New Perspectives on AI-Assisted Research

**Working with AI systematically:**

- From intuitive to explicit (clarifying what we want)
- From single-shot to iterative (refining through cycles)
- From acceptance to verification (evaluating outputs)
- From generic to tailored (adapting to specific needs)

## Mindset Shifts (cont.)

### New Perspectives on Research Practices

**These shifts apply to research too:**

- More explicit about requirements
- More systematic in evaluation
- More aware of IP constraints

:::{.fragment}
