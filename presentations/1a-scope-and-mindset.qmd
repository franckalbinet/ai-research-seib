# Why this course? {background-color="#40666e"}

## The Current Landscape

### AI & LLM: Between Hype and Reality

- **The buzz:** Revolutionary promises for research and productivity
- **The reality:** Mixed experiences, from enthusiasm to frustration
- **The concerns:** Quality, reliability, intellectual property, ethics

:::{.fragment}
[The AI design space is vast]{.alert} - many approaches, tools, and philosophies
:::

## The Challenge

### A Dynamic and Complex Domain

- New model classes emerging every few months
- Overwhelming choice of tools and platforms
- Need for clarity on what's actually happening "under the hood"

:::{.fragment}
**AI is a flexible tool** - but like any tool, it needs:

- Clear purpose
- Awareness of capabilities and limitations
- Thoughtful application to your specific needs
:::

## Our Philosophy

### AI as a Learning Companion

- **Not** a tool for delegating cognition
- **But** a partner for better and faster learning
- Goal: [Stay in control]{.alert} while enhancing our capabilities

:::{.fragment}
**Counter-intuitive insight:** AI saves time on boring tasks, but you'll spend *more* time on tasks you love - and do them better

# Topics in Detail {background-color="#40666e"}

## LLM Fundamentals

### Understanding What's Under the Hood

- How are LLMs trained? (High-level intuition)
- Why do they work? Why do they sometimes fail?
- **The three gulfs of AI system design:**
  - Gulf of understanding
  - Gulf of specification  
  - Gulf of generalization

:::{.fragment}
[Key insight:]{.alert} Understanding the fundamentals helps you use AI more effectively
:::

## Prompt Engineering

### From Basic to Advanced Techniques

- Summarizing scientific papers effectively
- Data extraction with precision and consistency
- **IP-aware prompting** (IAEA Monaco case study)
- Iterative refinement and evaluation

:::{.fragment}
**Hands-on focus:** You'll practice with real papers from your domains
:::

## Evaluation & Iterative Improvement

### Making AI Work Reliably for Research

- **LLM as a judge:** How to evaluate AI outputs systematically
- Error analysis and failure mode identification
- Iterative improvement cycles
- Simple evaluation tools (Excel-based approaches)

:::{.fragment}
[Central principle:]{.alert} Evaluation is not optional - it's essential for research quality
:::

## Literature Review Workflows

### Systematic Approaches to AI-Assisted Research

- Crafting effective LLM context for literature review
- Organizing and maintaining consistency over time
- Collaborative research strategies
- **From overwhelmed to organized**

:::{.fragment}
**Real challenge:** How do we stay in control while leveraging AI capabilities?
:::

## Tools & Mindsets

### Beyond the Hype: Choosing the Right Approach

- **Copilot vs. ChatGPT vs. Claude vs. DeepSeek**
- Platform comparison: NotebookLM, Elicit, specialized research tools
- **The SolveIt approach:** Maintaining control and transparency
- Agentic AI vs. collaborative AI philosophies

:::{.fragment}
[Key question:]{.alert} What mindset and level of control do you want?
:::

## Advanced Applications

### Real-World Implementation Examples

- **RAG systems:** IAEA Monaco marine radioactivity database
- Agentic literature review demonstrations
- Scaling from individual papers to comprehensive reviews
- Integration with existing research workflows

:::{.fragment}
**Live demos:** See these approaches in action with real research scenarios
:::

## Ethical & Epistemological Questions

### The Big Questions We Must Address

- **What do we expect from AI in research?**
- What should we delegate vs. what should we keep?
- Will AI help us do *better* research, or just *faster* research?
- **Authorship and attribution:** New challenges, new solutions

:::{.fragment}
**Intellectual Property considerations:**

- Copyright and fair use in AI-assisted research
- Institutional policies and journal guidelines
- Data ownership and sharing protocols
:::

## Collaborative Framework Building

### Creating Our Methodological Approach

- Synthesizing our collective insights and concerns
- Building practical guidelines for AI use in research
- **Goal:** A methodological document we can all use
- Individual consultation opportunities (6 additional days available)

:::{.fragment}
[Our aim:]{.alert} Leave with a clear, ethical, and effective approach to AI in your research
:::
