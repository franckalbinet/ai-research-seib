# AI Has Suddenly Arrived {background-color="#40666e"}

## The Current Moment

**Where we find ourselves:**

- AI entered our lives suddenly
- We're all oscillating between over-enthusiasm and unfounded fear
- It's being marketed as: **"Work much faster!"**

:::{.fragment}
But is that really what matters?

# The Reality of AI as a Tool {background-color="#40666e"}

## A Tool Is Only as Good as Its Use

**My experience with AI:**

- Less time on boring, repetitive tasks
- **MORE** time on what I cherish and care about
- Not about speed - about focus and intentionality

:::{.fragment}
[The value isn't faster work]{.alert} - it's better allocation of your time

# The Temptation {background-color="#40666e"}

## "Vibe Research"?

**In IT, there's "vibe coding":**

- Describe what you want
- Let agents execute unsupervised
- Hope for the best

:::{.fragment}
**We could imagine "vibe research writing"...**

- Describe your literature review needs
- Let AI run unsupervised
- Trust the output

# Our Approach {background-color="#40666e"}

## Intentional & Methodological

**This course demonstrates:**

- Everything you do is **intentional**
- Everything remains **under your control**
- Everything is **grounded** in theory and traditional experimental methods

:::{.fragment}
**Use case:** Literature review done right with AI

# The Week Ahead {background-color="#40666e"}

## Our Journey

**5 Days of hands-on practice:**

- **Day 1:** Experience the challenges (foundations)
- **Day 2:** Build effective prompts
- **Day 3:** Evaluate systematically
- **Day 4:** Synthesize literature reviews
- **Day 5:** Real-world applications & planning

# How We'll Work Together {background-color="#40666e"}

## Collaborative & Iterative

**Our approach:**

- Hands-on practice each day
- Shared Google docs for observations and collaboration
- Your feedback shapes the course
- We're exploring together

:::{.fragment}
**This is exploratory** - your input matters

## Individual & Collective Outputs

**By the end of the week:**

- **Individual:** Your own prompts and workflows for your domain
- **Collective:** Collaborative documentation/report
- **Goal:** A methodological approach you can actually use

# Let's Begin {background-color="#40666e"}

## Next Steps

**Coming up:**

- **Session 1B:** AI Platforms overview
- **Session 1C:** You'll try paper extraction yourself (hands-on)
- **Session 1D:** Making sense of the experience (Three Gulfs)
- **Session 1E:** Collaborative discussion
