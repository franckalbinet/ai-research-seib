# Use of AI for Literature Review

**A 5-Day Intensive Course on AI-Assisted Research**

*IAEA Laboratories, Seibersdorf, Austria | September 2025*

## Course Overview

This hands-on course explores how to effectively integrate AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) into literature review workflows. Rather than treating AI as a magic solution, we focus on developing a methodical, ethical approach that keeps researchers in control while enhancing their capabilities.

### Philosophy: AI as a Learning Companion

- AI as a partner for better and faster learning, not a replacement for critical thinking
- Focus on methodology over specific tools
- Emphasis on evaluation, reliability, and maintaining research quality

## What You'll Learn

### Core Topics
- **LLM Fundamentals**: Understanding how these systems work and why they sometimes fail
- **Advanced Prompt Engineering**: Extracting data and summarizing scientific papers effectively
- **Evaluation & Quality Control**: Systematic approaches to assess AI outputs
- **Research Workflows**: Organizing AI-assisted literature reviews
- **Tools & Platforms**: Comparing approaches from ChatGPT to specialized research tools
- **Ethics & IP**: Navigating copyright, attribution, and institutional policies
## 5-Day Schedule

### Day 1: Foundations & Getting Started
- Course philosophy and LLM fundamentals
- Collaborative session on expectations and concerns
- Introduction to prompt engineering for scientific papers

### Day 2: Deep Dive into Prompting
- Advanced prompt engineering techniques
- Data extraction and summarization practice
- Hands-on work with real research papers

### Day 3: Methodology & Workflows
- Literature review organization and workflows
- LLM evaluation and iterative improvement
- Collaborative problem-solving session

### Day 4: Tools & Advanced Applications
- Platform comparison and mindset differences
- RAG systems demonstration (IAEA Monaco case study)
- Agentic AI approaches

### Day 5: Integration & Future
- Collaborative framework building
- Ethical guidelines and IP considerations
- Individual consultation planning

## Course Approach

- **Interactive Learning**: Short lectures combined with extensive hands-on practice
- **Real-World Focus**: Work with actual scientific papers from your research domains
- **Collaborative**: Share experiences and build collective knowledge
- **Methodological**: Develop systematic approaches rather than ad-hoc tool use

## Key Questions We'll Address

- How can AI enhance research quality, not just speed?
- What should we delegate to AI vs. keep under human control?
- How do we evaluate AI outputs systematically?
- What are the ethical and IP implications for research?

## Getting Started with Quarto/Reveal.js

This course uses Quarto with Reveal.js for interactive presentations.

### Setup
To use the same template as the course materials:
```bash
quarto use template grantmcdermott/quarto-revealjs-clean-demo
```

### Viewing Presentations
To render and view a presentation file:
```bash
quarto preview my-presentation.qmd
```
This will open the presentation in your local browser with live reload.

### Converting to PDF
Built-in print stylesheet (recommended): Quarto reveal.js presentations can be exported to PDF via a special print stylesheet. Simply add `?print-pdf` to your presentation URL, open the browser print dialog (Ctrl+P), change destination to "Save as PDF", set layout to landscape, margins to none, and enable background graphics.
