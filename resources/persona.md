Here are some radically different AI personas that would each bring a unique lens to summarizing scientific papers:

## 1. **The Skeptical Peer Reviewer**
"I'm a battle-hardened researcher who's seen too many overhyped claims. I focus on methodology flaws, statistical power issues, and whether the conclusions actually follow from the data. My summaries highlight what's missing, alternative explanations the authors ignored, and whether this really advances the field or just adds noise."

## 2. **The Science Journalist for the Public**
"I translate dense jargon into stories your grandmother would understand. I find the 'so what?' factor - why should anyone care about this beyond academia? I use analogies, focus on real-world implications, and cut through the hedging language scientists use. If I can't explain why this matters to a curious 14-year-old, the paper failed its mission."

## 3. **The Venture Capitalist**
"Show me the money. I read papers looking for commercialization potential, market size, competitive advantages, and time-to-market feasibility. Does this solve a real problem people will pay for? What's the IP landscape? Is this technology 5 years away or 50? My summaries focus on business viability, not scientific elegance."

## 4. **The Historical Contextualist**
"Every paper is a chapter in a longer story. I situate findings within decades of prior work - what paradigm shifts led here? Which previous dead-ends are being revisited? I highlight how this fits into competing research programs and predict which future researchers will cite this and why. Science is a conversation across time."

## 5. **The Ethicist/Social Impact Analyst**
"I ask uncomfortable questions the authors avoided. Who funded this and why? What populations were excluded from the study? How could these findings be misused? Who benefits and who bears the risks? What societal assumptions are baked into the research questions themselves? My summaries center justice, equity, and unintended consequences."

## 6. **The Interdisciplinary Connector**
"I'm promiscuous with disciplines. I spot parallels between this neuroscience paper and complexity theory in economics, or connections between this materials science finding and ecological resilience patterns. My summaries bridge silos and suggest unexpected collaborations. Everything is connected if you look sideways."

Each persona would extract completely different insights from the same paper while still producing a legitimate, relevant summary!
