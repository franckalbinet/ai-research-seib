**Text:**  
Gamma irradiation is used to sterilize male insects before their release into the environment. The radiation causes chromosomal damage that prevents reproduction while maintaining the insects' ability to mate and compete with wild males.

### Training Example 2
**ID:** labeled_002  
**Difficulty:** easy  
**Label:** original

**Text:**  
The Sterile Insect Technique represents a species-specific and environmentally friendly method of pest control. Male insects are sterilized through irradiation and then released into wild populations. These sterile males compete with wild males for mates, but produce no offspring, leading to population decline over successive generations.

**Source Text:**  
"Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) is an environmentally-friendly insect pest control method involving the mass-rearing and sterilization, using radiation, of a target pest, followed by the systematic area-wide release of the sterile males by air over defined areas. The released sterile insects mate with wild insects of the target population. As there is no offspring, the pest population declines." (IAEA SIT Overview, 2019)

### Training Example 3
**ID:** labeled_005  
**Difficulty:** moderate  
**Label:** plagiarized (synonym substitution)

**Text:**  
Isotopic methods offer important instruments for studying soil moisture movement and nutrient transformation in farming systems. Through monitoring the flow of isotope-tagged materials, scientists can enhance irrigation strategies and fertilizer use, thereby increasing water efficiency and minimizing ecological consequences.

**Source Text:**  
"Isotopic techniques provide valuable tools for understanding soil water dynamics and nutrient cycling in agricultural systems. By tracking the movement of isotopically labeled compounds, researchers can optimize irrigation practices and fertilizer application, ultimately improving water use efficiency and reducing environmental impact." (Soil Science Journal, 2021)

**Difficulty:** moderate  
**Label:** plagiarized (patchwriting)

**Text:**  
Animal diseases that cross borders pose serious risks to livestock production and human health worldwide. Nuclear and nuclear-derived techniques enable rapid and accurate disease diagnosis, allowing for timely intervention. These diagnostic tools are especially important in developing countries where access to sophisticated laboratory facilities is limited.

**Source Text:**  
"Animal diseases that cross borders pose serious risks to livestock sectors and human health. Molecular diagnostic methods, including those based on nuclear technologies like radioimmunoassay and isotope-labeled probes, provide sensitive and specific detection of pathogens. Such tools are especially important in developing countries where access to sophisticated laboratory facilities is limited." (Veterinary Diagnostics Review, 2021)

**ID:** labeled_009  
**Difficulty:** moderate  
**Label:** original

**Text:**  
Transboundary animal diseases represent major threats to livestock production and food security worldwide. Nuclear and nuclear-derived techniques enable rapid and accurate disease diagnosis, allowing for timely intervention and control measures. These diagnostic tools are particularly valuable in resource-limited settings where traditional laboratory infrastructure may be inadequate.

**Text:**  
The process is effective against all insect life stages from eggs to adults, and maintains product quality attributes. Food irradiation provides a non-chemical approach to insect disinfestation in stored commodities and fresh fruits. Growing numbers of countries accept irradiation as a phytosanitary treatment meeting international trade requirements.
