African animal trypanosomiasis, transmitted by tsetse flies, constrains livestock productivity across 37 sub-Saharan countries. Integrated control approaches combining sterile insect technique with targets, traps, and trypanocidal drugs offer sustainable solutions. Several countries have achieved local elimination of tsetse populations using these methods.

Pink bollworm populations in cotton-growing regions of the southwestern United States have been eliminated through area-wide sterile insect releases combined with other management practices. The success required coordination among farmers, researchers, and government agencies across multiple states. Cotton growers now benefit from reduced insecticide use and lower production costs.

**Source Text:**  
"The pink bollworm has been eradicated from cotton production areas in the southwestern United States through integrated area-wide management incorporating sterile insect technique. Success depended on collaborative efforts involving growers, scientists, and regulatory authorities across state boundaries. Elimination of this pest has resulted in decreased reliance on insecticides and improved economic returns for cotton producers." (Journal of Economic Entomology, 2018)

The definitive method for quantifying contaminants and adulterants in food samples is isotope dilution mass spectrometry. Precise amounts of isotopically labeled compounds are added as internal standards prior to sample processing. This strategy compensates for matrix interferences and provides accurate measurements across a wide range of food matrices.
