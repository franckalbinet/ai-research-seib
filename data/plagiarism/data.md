Stable isotope ratios of oxygen-18 in plant biomass indicate water use efficiency and plant water status under varying conditions. This information helps breeders select genotypes with superior water-saving characteristics. The technique is non-invasive and can be applied throughout the growing season.

"Stable isotope ratios of oxygen-18 in plant biomass provide indicators of water use efficiency and plant water status under varying environmental and management conditions. Breeders utilize these measurements to identify genotypes with favorable water relations traits. The method offers advantages of being non-destructive and applicable at multiple growth stages."
