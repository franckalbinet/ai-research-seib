# Research Workflow Mapping Session

## Current Literature Review Practices
- "How many papers do you typically review for a project?"
- "Where do you store your notes - Word docs? Spreadsheets? Something else?"
- "Do you read papers sequentially or jump around sections?"

## Pain Points & Challenges  
- "What takes the longest - finding papers or extracting info?"
- "Ever lost important details because your notes were unclear?"

## Must-Have Information from Papers
**Triggers:**
- "What's the first thing you look for in a paper's results section?"
- "Do you extract methodology details? Which ones matter most?"
- "How do you capture statistical findings - copy exact numbers or summarize?"

## Quality Control Methods
**Triggers:**
- "How do you make sure you didn't miss anything important?"
- "Ever go back to re-read because your notes weren't clear enough?"
- "Do you use any templates or checklists?"

## Tools & Systems Currently Used
**Triggers:**
- "Quick poll - Mendeley, Zotero, EndNote, or something else?"
- "Do you annotate PDFs directly or take separate notes?"****

## Dream Scenarios
**Triggers:**
- "If you could automate one part of literature review, what would it be?"
- "What would your perfect paper summary look like?"
- "How would you want to compare findings across 20 papers?"
- "If you had unlimited time, what would you extract that you currently skip?"
